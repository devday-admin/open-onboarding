### Using AI for Day 1
**Try asking your AI:**
- "Explain the folder structure of this codebase"
- "Where should I start exploring as a new developer?"
- "What documentation should I read first?"

## Week 1: Learning & Exploration

### Codebase Understanding
- [ ] Read main README and getting started docs
- [ ] Understand project architecture (ask AI for overview)

- [ ] Know how to run linter/formatter
- [ ] Understand code review process
- [ ] Learn deployment/CI-CD pipeline basics

### First Contributions
- [ ] Fix a typo or update documentation
- [ ] Make a small UI tweak or bug fix
- [ ] Write a test for existing code

- [ ] Merge your first PR! 🎉

### Team Integration
- [ ] Attend team meetings/standups
- [ ] Understand team rituals and ceremonies
- [ ] Learn communication norms
- [ ] Identify who to ask for different types of help

### Using AI for Week 1
**AI Config**: `first_week_developer.md` or `onboarding_buddy.rules`

**Ask about:**
- Architecture and design patterns
- "How does [feature] work?"
- "Where is [functionality] implemented?"
- "Explain this code section to me"
- "What are the testing patterns here?"

## Week 2: Gaining Confidence

### Deeper Understanding

- [ ] Write comprehensive tests for your changes

### Team Contribution
- [ ] Ask questions in team channels
- [ ] Share something you learned
- [ ] Help document something unclear
- [ ] Provide fresh perspective in discussions

### Using AI for Week 2
**Try pair programming config** if available

**Ask about:**
- "Help me implement [feature]"
- "Review my approach to [problem]"
- "What's the best way to test this?"
- "Are there edge cases I'm missing?"

## Week 3-4: Building Independence

### Independent Work
- [ ] Take on features end-to-end
- [ ] Estimate your own tasks
- [ ] Make architectural decisions (small scope)

- [ ] Share a useful resource with the team
- [ ] Ask advanced questions

### Using AI for Week 3-4
**Consider if you're ready for standard configs**

**Ask about:**
- "What's the best architecture for [feature]?"
- "How does this compare to [alternative approach]?"
- "Review my implementation approach"
- "Help me refactor this code"

## Month 2: Full Team Member

- [ ] Work on regular team tasks
- [ ] Participate fully in sprint planning
- [ ] Provide meaningful code reviews
- [ ] Help with technical decisions
- [ ] Mentor newer team members

## Using This Checklist with AI

**Track progress**: Ask AI to help you track what you've completed
**Get guidance**: Ask AI to explain items you don't understand
**Plan your day**: Ask AI to help prioritize what to focus on
**Reflect**: Ask AI to help you review what you've learned

## Remember

- **Everyone's timeline is different** - Don't stress if you're faster/slower
- **It's okay to not know things** - That's why you're onboarding!
- **Ask questions** - The "dumb" question is the one not asked
- **Mistakes are learning** - Especially in your first weeks
- **AI is your assistant** - Use it to learn and accelerate, not replace thinking

## Feedback
