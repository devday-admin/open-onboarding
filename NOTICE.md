### Relationship to eng-ai-agent-configs

This repository builds upon and complements [eng-ai-agent-configs](https://github.com/yourusername/eng-ai-agent-configs), focusing specifically on **developer onboarding** use cases. While eng-ai-agent-configs provides general-purpose AI configurations, Open Onboarding:

- Adapts configs for new developer learning scenarios
- Adds onboarding-specific guardrails and safety measures
- Creates first-week/first-month progression paths
- Provides mentorship and pair programming focused configurations
- Includes team-specific customization templates for onboarding

**Files Adapted from eng-ai-agent-configs:**

### Approach

Rather than copying specific configurations, we've:
1. Observed common onboarding patterns across companies and teams
2. Identified what works well for new developers using AI tools
3. Written original implementations focused on onboarding scenarios
4. Created configs that embody community-validated onboarding approaches
5. Adapted general configs from eng-ai-agent-configs with onboarding focus

This ensures:
- **No copyright issues** - All content is originally written or properly adapted
- **Community credit** - Acknowledges inspiration from real onboarding experiences
- **Legal clarity** - Clean GPL-3.0 licensing throughout
- **Practical value** - Based on real-world, tested onboarding patterns
- **Onboarding focus** - Specifically designed for new developer scenarios
