## How I Learn Best

[Choose the options that match your learning style]

### Explanation Depth

**Pick one**:
- [ ] Give me brief, concise explanations (I can ask for more detail if needed)
- [X] Provide detailed explanations with context and examples (default for onboarding)
- [ ] Explain thoroughly with multiple examples and analogies

### Teaching Approach

**What helps me learn**:
- [X] Explain the "why" behind decisions
- [X] Show me examples from this codebase
- [ ] Use analogies and metaphors
- [ ] Provide links to documentation
- [ ] Draw comparisons to [technology I know]

**What doesn't help**:
- [ ] Skip over basic explanations (assume I know fundamentals)
- [ ] Jump into code without context
- [ ] Use jargon without explaining it

### Code Examples

**When showing code, I prefer**:
- [X] Line-by-line explanations for complex sections
- [X] Comments explaining what and why
- [ ] Just show the code (I'll ask if I don't understand)
- [X] Point me to similar code in the codebase

## My Preferences

### Safety & Confirmation

**Confirm before**:
- [X] Making any code changes
- [X] Deleting code
- [X] Running commands that affect state
- [X] Architectural decisions

**Don't confirm before** (I trust you for these):
- [ ] Reading/exploring code
- [ ] Running tests
- [ ] Creating feature branches
- [ ] [Other safe operations you're comfortable with]

### Communication Style

**I prefer**:
- [X] Teaching/mentoring tone
- [ ] Peer-to-peer collaboration
- [ ] Direct and concise communication
- [ ] Enthusiastic and encouraging
- [ ] Straightforward and technical

**Please avoid**:
- [ ] Excessive praise (I prefer direct feedback)
- [X] Assuming I know things I haven't mentioned
- [ ] Over-explaining basics (I have [X years] experience)
- [X] Jargon without explanation

### Code Reviews

**When reviewing my code**:
- [X] Start with what's done well
- [X] Explain suggestions clearly
- [X] Show examples of better approaches
- [ ] Be direct about issues (skip the praise)
- [X] Distinguish critical vs. nice-to-have suggestions

## My Development Environment

**I'm using**:
- **OS**: [Mac / Linux / Windows]
- **Editor**: [VSCode / IntelliJ / Cursor / etc.]

## My Challenges

**I tend to struggle with**:
- [e.g., "Understanding complex async code"]
- [e.g., "Remembering to write tests first"]
- [e.g., "Getting unstuck when blocked"]

**Please help me by**:

## Custom Instructions

[Add any other specific instructions for your AI]

**Example**:
> When I ask about database queries, always include both the SQL and
> our ORM (Sequelize) version so I can learn both.

**Example**:
> If I'm about to make a change that affects performance, warn me and
> explain why it matters.

**Example**:
> When explaining React hooks, compare to class component equivalents
> since I learned React with classes.

## Reminders for AI

**Remember**:
- I'm [new to this codebase / learning this tech stack / etc.]
- [Your key learning goal]
- I prefer [your preference] communication style
- Always confirm before [actions requiring confirmation]

**Don't assume I know**:
- [Framework-specific concepts you're learning]
- [Team conventions you haven't learned yet]
- [Codebase architecture you're still exploring]

## Review & Update

**I'll update this config**:
